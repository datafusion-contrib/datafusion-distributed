Distributed DataFusion is a library for bringing distributed capabilities to DataFusion.
It provides a set of `ExecutionPlan`s, optimization rules, config extensions and some new traits
to enable distributed execution.

This user guide will walk you through the process of using the tools in this project for setting up
your own distributed DataFusion cluster.
